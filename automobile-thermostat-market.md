<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Thermostat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Folding</li><li>Wax Type</li><li>Bimetallic Thermocouple</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automobile thermostat market includes various types like folding, wax, and bimetallic thermocouple thermostats. Folding thermostats use a bellows mechanism to regulate coolant flow based on temperature changes. Wax-type thermostats rely on a wax pellet that expands when heated, opening the valve to control coolant circulation. Bimetallic thermocouple thermostats utilize two metal strips with different thermal expansion rates, bending to open or close the valve. Each type ensures optimal engine temperature, enhancing performance and fuel efficiency while preventing overheating in automotive systems.</p></p>
