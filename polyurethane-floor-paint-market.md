<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Floor Paint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Polyurethane Floor Paint</li><li>Non-Solvent Polyurethane Floor Paint</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane floor paint is a durable coating used to protect and enhance floors. Solvent-based polyurethane floor paint contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that evaporate during drying, offering strong adhesion, quick drying, and high durability, making it suitable for industrial and heavy-use areas. Non-solvent (water-based) polyurethane floor paint is eco-friendly, low in VOCs, and emits fewer odors, ideal for residential or light commercial spaces. Both types provide excellent resistance to wear, chemicals, and abrasion, but differ in application, drying time, and environmental impact.</p></p>
